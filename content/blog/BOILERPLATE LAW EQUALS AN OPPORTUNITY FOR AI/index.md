The legal profession is known for its complexity, attention to detail, and the need for accuracy in all documents and contracts. However, a significant portion of legal work in Canada is boilerplate. In this context, lawyers use past principles and documents from their own work and make changes to names and dates to repurpose that old work for customers. While this practice has some advantages in maintaining objectivity and consistency in a field that requires both, it is also inefficient, as it takes time and resources to review repurposed work. Furthermore, the risk of small mistakes such as typos can have serious consequences.  

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the way lawyers work and the speed and accuracy of their output. The use of AI-powered technology can streamline the process of creating and reviewing boilerplate documents, reduce the risk of errors, and ensure that the documents are consistent and objective.
